# Write a Python function, fourth_power, that takes in one number and
# returns that value raised to the fourth power.
# You should use the square procedure that you defined in an earlier
# exercise (you don't need to redefine square in this box; when you call
# square, the grader will use our definition).
# This function takes in one number and returns one number.
